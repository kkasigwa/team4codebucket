This document includes License Information documents below for multiple Programs. Each License Information document identifies the Program(s) to which it applies. Only those License Information documents for the Program(s) for which Licensee has acquired entitlements apply.


==============================================
IMPORTANT: READ CAREFULLY

Two license agreements are presented below.

1. IBM International License Agreement for Evaluation of Programs
2. IBM International Program License Agreement

If Licensee is obtaining the Program for purposes of productive use (other than evaluation, testing, trial "try or buy," or demonstration): By clicking on the "Accept" button below, Licensee accepts the IBM International Program License Agreement, without modification.

If Licensee is obtaining the Program for the purpose of evaluation, testing, trial "try or buy," or demonstration (collectively, an "Evaluation"): By clicking on the "Accept" button below, Licensee accepts both (i) the IBM International License Agreement for Evaluation of Programs (the "Evaluation License"), without modification; and (ii) the IBM International Program License Agreement (the "IPLA"), without modification.

The Evaluation License will apply during the term of Licensee's Evaluation.

The IPLA will automatically apply if Licensee elects to retain the Program after the Evaluation (or obtain additional copies of the Program for use after the Evaluation) by entering into a procurement agreement (e.g., the IBM International Passport Advantage or the IBM Passport Advantage Express agreements).

The Evaluation License and the IPLA are not in effect concurrently; neither modifies the other; and each is independent of the other.

The complete text of each of these two license agreements follow.

LICENSE INFORMATION

The Programs listed below are licensed under the following License Information terms and conditions in addition to the Program license terms previously agreed to by Client and IBM. If Client does not have previously agreed to license terms in effect for the Program, the International License Agreement for Evaluation of Programs (i125-5543-06) applies.

Program Name (Program Number):
IBM MQ 9.4 (Evaluation)
IBM MQ for Non-Production Environment 9.4 (Evaluation)

The following standard terms apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

The following units of measure may apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

Processor Value Unit (PVU)

Processor Value Unit (PVU) is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. The number of PVU entitlements required is based on the processor technology (defined within the Processor Value Unit (PVU) licensing for Distributed Software website at https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/pvu_licensing_for_customers.html) and the number of processors made available to the Program. IBM continues to define a processor, for the purpose of PVU-based licensing, to be each processor core on a chip. A dual-core processor chip, for example, has two processor cores.

Licensee can deploy the Program (if supported) using full capacity licensing, sub-capacity licensing (https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/subcaplicensing.html), or container licensing (https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/containerlicenses.html). See the linked websites for more information.

Virtual Processor Core

Virtual Processor Core is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. A Physical Server is a physical computer that is comprised of processing units, memory, and input/output capabilities and that executes requested procedures, commands, or applications for one or more users or client devices. Where racks, blade enclosures, or other similar equipment is being employed, each separable physical device (for example, a blade or a rack-mounted device) that has the required components is considered itself a separate Physical Server. A Virtual Server is either a virtual computer created by partitioning the resources available to a Physical Server or an unpartitioned Physical Server. A Processor Core is a functional unit within a computing device that interprets and executes instructions. A Processor Core consists of at least one instruction control unit and one or more arithmetic or logic units. A Virtual Processor Core is a Processor Core in an unpartitioned Physical Server, or a virtual core assigned to a Virtual Server. Licensee must obtain entitlements for each Virtual Processor Core made available to the Program.

Licensee can deploy the Program (if supported) using full capacity licensing, sub-capacity licensing (https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/subcaplicensing.html), or container licensing (https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/containerlicenses.html). See the linked websites for more information. 

Virtual Server

Virtual Server is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. A server is a physical computer that is comprised of processing units, memory, and input/output capabilities and that executes requested procedures, commands, or applications for one or more users or client devices. Where racks, blade enclosures, or other similar equipment is being employed, each separable physical device (for example, a blade or a rack-mounted device) that has the required components is considered itself a separate server. A virtual server is either a virtual computer created by partitioning the resources available to a physical server or an unpartitioned physical server. Licensee must obtain Virtual Server entitlements for each virtual server made available to the Program, regardless of the number of processor cores in the virtual server or the number of copies of the Program on the virtual server.

In addition to the above, the following terms apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

A. Native High Availability Feature

Licensee's use of the native high availability (automatic failover) feature of the Program ("Native High Availability") requires configuration on three servers and requires that all queue managers on the three servers are Native High Availability Queue Managers. The Program must be licensed on one server by obtaining entitlements to IBM MQ Advanced, but the two replica servers are not used to determine the number of entitlements required for the Program.

B. Other High Availability Features

Licensee's use of other high availability (automatic failover) features will require Licensee to obtain sufficient entitlement to IBM MQ High Availability Replica or IBM MQ Advanced High Availability Replica (each a "High Availability Replica") to cover Licensee's high availability requirements as described in the separate license terms accompanying the High Availability Replica.

The following units of measure may apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

Processor Value Unit (PVU)

Processor Value Unit (PVU) is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. The number of PVU entitlements required is based on the processor technology (defined within the Processor Value Unit (PVU) licensing for Distributed Software website at https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/pvu_licensing_for_customers.html) and the number of processors made available to the Program. IBM continues to define a processor, for the purpose of PVU-based licensing, to be each processor core on a chip. A dual-core processor chip, for example, has two processor cores.

Licensee can deploy the Program (if supported) using full capacity licensing, sub-capacity licensing (https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/subcaplicensing.html), or container licensing (https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/containerlicenses.html). See the linked websites for more information.

Virtual Processor Core

Virtual Processor Core is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. A Physical Server is a physical computer that is comprised of processing units, memory, and input/output capabilities and that executes requested procedures, commands, or applications for one or more users or client devices. Where racks, blade enclosures, or other similar equipment is being employed, each separable physical device (for example, a blade or a rack-mounted device) that has the required components is considered itself a separate Physical Server. A Virtual Server is either a virtual computer created by partitioning the resources available to a Physical Server or an unpartitioned Physical Server. A Processor Core is a functional unit within a computing device that interprets and executes instructions. A Processor Core consists of at least one instruction control unit and one or more arithmetic or logic units. A Virtual Processor Core is a Processor Core in an unpartitioned Physical Server, or a virtual core assigned to a Virtual Server. Licensee must obtain entitlements for each Virtual Processor Core made available to the Program.

Licensee can deploy the Program (if supported) using full capacity licensing, sub-capacity licensing (https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/subcaplicensing.html), or container licensing (https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/containerlicenses.html). See the linked websites for more information. 

Virtual Server

Virtual Server is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. A server is a physical computer that is comprised of processing units, memory, and input/output capabilities and that executes requested procedures, commands, or applications for one or more users or client devices. Where racks, blade enclosures, or other similar equipment is being employed, each separable physical device (for example, a blade or a rack-mounted device) that has the required components is considered itself a separate server. A virtual server is either a virtual computer created by partitioning the resources available to a physical server or an unpartitioned physical server. Licensee must obtain Virtual Server entitlements for each virtual server made available to the Program, regardless of the number of processor cores in the virtual server or the number of copies of the Program on the virtual server.

In addition to the above, the following terms apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

A. Native High Availability Feature

Licensee's use of the native high availability (automatic failover) feature of the Program ("Native High Availability") requires configuration on three servers and requires that all queue managers on the three servers are Native High Availability Queue Managers. The Program must be licensed on one server by obtaining entitlements to IBM MQ Advanced, but the two replica servers are not used to determine the number of entitlements required for the Program.

B. Other High Availability Features

Licensee's use of other high availability (automatic failover) features will require Licensee to obtain sufficient entitlement to IBM MQ High Availability Replica or IBM MQ Advanced High Availability Replica (each a "High Availability Replica") to cover Licensee's high availability requirements as described in the separate license terms accompanying the High Availability Replica.

Virtual Server

Virtual Server is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. A server is a physical computer that is comprised of processing units, memory, and input/output capabilities and that executes requested procedures, commands, or applications for one or more users or client devices. Where racks, blade enclosures, or other similar equipment is being employed, each separable physical device (for example, a blade or a rack-mounted device) that has the required components is considered itself a separate server. A virtual server is either a virtual computer created by partitioning the resources available to a physical server or an unpartitioned physical server. Licensee must obtain Virtual Server entitlements for each virtual server made available to the Program, regardless of the number of processor cores in the virtual server or the number of copies of the Program on the virtual server.

In addition to the above, the following terms apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

A. Licensee's use of the Program is limited to use of the following features as stated below or as stated in the Other High Availability Solutions section. 

1. Multi-Instance Queue Manager Feature

Licensee is permitted to use the multi-instance queue manager feature of the Program for Stand-by Purposes only. Stand-by Purposes are defined as having the Program started, but ensuring that the Program remains idle unless the active and separately entitled IBM MQ copy of the program fails over to the high availability replica Program. If this occurs, the high availability replica Program may be used to carry out productive work during the period of failover. The Program is considered "idle" if, until a failover takes place, it is not used to carry out productive work of any kind and is used exclusively for administrative actions. 

2. Replicated Data Queue Manager High Availability Feature

Licensee's use of this replicated data queue manager feature of the Program requires configuration on three servers and requires that all queue managers on the three servers be Replicated Data Queue Managers. Two of the servers may be configured and entitled as IBM MQ Advanced High Availability Replica, but the copy of IBM MQ on the third configured server must be licensed separately by obtaining entitlements to IBM MQ Advanced. When using this high availability feature in conjunction with replication to a disaster recovery site, the three high availability servers at the disaster recovery site must also be entitled as described above.

3. Replicated Data Queue Manager Disaster Recovery Feature

Licensee's use of this replicated data queue manager feature of the Program requires configuration on two servers and requires that all queue managers on the two servers be Replicated Data Queue Managers. One of the servers may be configured and entitled as a IBM MQ Advanced High Availability Replica, but the copy of IBM MQ on the second configured server must be licensed separately by obtaining entitlements to IBM MQ Advanced. This disaster recovery configuration of two servers is a separate configuration to using three servers as a high availability configuration, even when that is used with replication to a disaster recovery site. 

B. Other High Availability Solutions

If Licensee chooses to use other high availability (automatic failover) solutions along with the Program, Licensee is permitted to use the Program as a high availability replica so long as it resides for backup purposes on a standby server and the Program is not started. The Program may be started automatically by the high availability components in the event of the active server failing, in which event the Program may be used to carry out productive work during the period of failover.

The following units of measure may apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

Processor Value Unit (PVU)

Processor Value Unit (PVU) is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. The number of PVU entitlements required is based on the processor technology (defined within the Processor Value Unit (PVU) licensing for Distributed Software website at https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/pvu_licensing_for_customers.html) and the number of processors made available to the Program. IBM continues to define a processor, for the purpose of PVU-based licensing, to be each processor core on a chip. A dual-core processor chip, for example, has two processor cores.

Licensee can deploy the Program (if supported) using full capacity licensing, sub-capacity licensing (https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/subcaplicensing.html), or container licensing (https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/containerlicenses.html). See the linked websites for more information.

In addition to the above, the following terms apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

A. Licensee's use of the Program is limited to use of the following features as stated below or as stated in the Other High Availability Solutions section. 

1. Multi-Instance Queue Manager Feature

Licensee is permitted to use the multi-instance queue manager feature of the Program for Stand-by Purposes only. Stand-by Purposes are defined as having the Program started, but ensuring that the Program remains idle unless the active and separately entitled IBM MQ copy of the program fails over to the high availability replica Program. If this occurs, the high availability replica Program may be used to carry out productive work during the period of failover. The Program is considered "idle" if, until a failover takes place, it is not used to carry out productive work of any kind and is used exclusively for administrative actions. 

2. Replicated Data Queue Manager High Availability Feature

Licensee's use of this replicated data queue manager feature of the Program requires configuration on three servers and requires that all queue managers on the three servers be Replicated Data Queue Managers. Two of the servers may be configured and entitled as IBM MQ Advanced High Availability Replica, but the copy of IBM MQ on the third configured server must be licensed separately by obtaining entitlements to IBM MQ Advanced. When using this high availability feature in conjunction with replication to a disaster recovery site, the three high availability servers at the disaster recovery site must also be entitled as described above.

3. Replicated Data Queue Manager Disaster Recovery Feature

Licensee's use of this replicated data queue manager feature of the Program requires configuration on two servers and requires that all queue managers on the two servers be Replicated Data Queue Managers. One of the servers may be configured and entitled as a IBM MQ Advanced High Availability Replica, but the copy of IBM MQ on the second configured server must be licensed separately by obtaining entitlements to IBM MQ Advanced. This disaster recovery configuration of two servers is a separate configuration to using three servers as a high availability configuration, even when that is used with replication to a disaster recovery site. 

B. Other High Availability Solutions

If Licensee chooses to use other high availability (automatic failover) solutions along with the Program, Licensee is permitted to use the Program as a high availability replica so long as it resides for backup purposes on a standby server and the Program is not started. The Program may be started automatically by the high availability components in the event of the active server failing, in which event the Program may be used to carry out productive work during the period of failover.

(a) IBM provides it to Licensee WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND AND DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL EXPRESS AND IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE WARRANTY OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR NON-INTERFERENCE, AND THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE;
(b) IBM is not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages including, but not limited to, lost data, lost savings, and lost profits.

Source Components and Sample Materials

The Program includes components in source code form ("Source Components"), or other materials identified as Sample Materials or both. Licensee may copy and modify Source Components and Sample Materials for internal use only within the limits of the license rights under this Agreement; provided, however, that Licensee may not alter or delete any copyright information or notices contained in the Source Components or Sample Materials. IBM provides the Source Components and Sample Materials without obligation of support and "AS IS", WITH NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE WARRANTY OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR NON-INTERFERENCE AND THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

The following units of measure may apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

Processor Value Unit (PVU)

Processor Value Unit (PVU) is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. The number of PVU entitlements required is based on the processor technology (defined within the Processor Value Unit (PVU) licensing for Distributed Software website at https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/pvu_licensing_for_customers.html) and the number of processors made available to the Program. IBM continues to define a processor, for the purpose of PVU-based licensing, to be each processor core on a chip. A dual-core processor chip, for example, has two processor cores.

Licensee can deploy the Program (if supported) using full capacity licensing, sub-capacity licensing (https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/subcaplicensing.html), or container licensing (https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/containerlicenses.html). See the linked websites for more information.

Virtual Processor Core

Virtual Processor Core is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. A Physical Server is a physical computer that is comprised of processing units, memory, and input/output capabilities and that executes requested procedures, commands, or applications for one or more users or client devices. Where racks, blade enclosures, or other similar equipment is being employed, each separable physical device (for example, a blade or a rack-mounted device) that has the required components is considered itself a separate Physical Server. A Virtual Server is either a virtual computer created by partitioning the resources available to a Physical Server or an unpartitioned Physical Server. A Processor Core is a functional unit within a computing device that interprets and executes instructions. A Processor Core consists of at least one instruction control unit and one or more arithmetic or logic units. A Virtual Processor Core is a Processor Core in an unpartitioned Physical Server, or a virtual core assigned to a Virtual Server. Licensee must obtain entitlements for each Virtual Processor Core made available to the Program.

Licensee can deploy the Program (if supported) using full capacity licensing, sub-capacity licensing (https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/subcaplicensing.html), or container licensing (https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/containerlicenses.html). See the linked websites for more information. 

Virtual Server

Virtual Server is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. A server is a physical computer that is comprised of processing units, memory, and input/output capabilities and that executes requested procedures, commands, or applications for one or more users or client devices. Where racks, blade enclosures, or other similar equipment is being employed, each separable physical device (for example, a blade or a rack-mounted device) that has the required components is considered itself a separate server. A virtual server is either a virtual computer created by partitioning the resources available to a physical server or an unpartitioned physical server. Licensee must obtain Virtual Server entitlements for each virtual server made available to the Program, regardless of the number of processor cores in the virtual server or the number of copies of the Program on the virtual server.

In addition to the above, the following terms apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

A. Licensee's use of the Program is limited to use of the following features as stated below or as stated in the Other High Availability Solutions section. 

1. Multi-Instance Queue Manager Feature

Licensee is permitted to use the multi-instance queue manager feature of the Program for Stand-by Purposes only. Stand-by Purposes are defined as having the Program started, but ensuring that the Program remains idle unless the active and separately entitled IBM MQ copy of the program fails over to the high availability replica Program. If this occurs, the high availability replica Program may be used to carry out productive work during the period of failover. The Program is considered "idle" if, until a failover takes place, it is not used to carry out productive work of any kind and is used exclusively for administrative actions. 

2. Replicated Data Queue Manager High Availability Feature

Licensee's use of this replicated data queue manager feature of the Program requires configuration on three servers and requires that all queue managers on the three servers be Replicated Data Queue Managers. Two of the servers may be configured and entitled as IBM MQ Advanced High Availability Replica, but the copy of IBM MQ on the third configured server must be licensed separately by obtaining entitlements to IBM MQ Advanced. When using this high availability feature in conjunction with replication to a disaster recovery site, the three high availability servers at the disaster recovery site must also be entitled as described above.

3. Replicated Data Queue Manager Disaster Recovery Feature

Licensee's use of this replicated data queue manager feature of the Program requires configuration on two servers and requires that all queue managers on the two servers be Replicated Data Queue Managers. One of the servers may be configured and entitled as a IBM MQ Advanced High Availability Replica, but the copy of IBM MQ on the second configured server must be licensed separately by obtaining entitlements to IBM MQ Advanced. This disaster recovery configuration of two servers is a separate configuration to using three servers as a high availability configuration, even when that is used with replication to a disaster recovery site. 

B. Other High Availability Solutions

If Licensee chooses to use other high availability (automatic failover) solutions along with the Program, Licensee is permitted to use the Program as a high availability replica so long as it resides for backup purposes on a standby server and the Program is not started. The Program may be started automatically by the high availability components in the event of the active server failing, in which event the Program may be used to carry out productive work during the period of failover.
