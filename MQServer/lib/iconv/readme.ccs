Notes:
======
Conversion from an SBCS codepage to a Mixed codepage is accepted with the Mixed codepage
being treated as though it was purely sbcs. This means that any double byte characters
in an incoming mixed codepage (or SO/SI characters if its EBCDIC) will be treated as 
though they are two seperate SBCS characters when being converted into an SBCS codepage.
Thus for example 932 to 897 would be treated as though it was 897 to 897, and (in this
particular case) copying rather than conversion would take place. Another example would
be 37 to 932 which would be treated as 37 to 897.
